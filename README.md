The Odin Project: To-Do List

*Struggles with task management got you feeling dumb? Maybe you need IDOIT!*

## Structure
In an effort to avoid over-engineering, I'm starting by basically implementing a "model-view-controller" structure without a controller. I'm pretty sure this means I **will** be doing a lot of refactoring, but the process of refactoring what MUST be refactored is probably a better learning experience than trying to predict what MIGHT ought to be refactored. If I want to know where to put a sunshade, first I gotta see where the sun is actually shining.
